This file finder function uses recursion to find all files with the given file name suffix.
Time complexity will depend 1) the number of branches 'b' and the depth 'd' for each branch.
This is O(b^d). And 2) os.listdir(path) has to iterate through a list of n items, which worst-case and average-case is O(n) time. 
So the total time complexity is O(b^d)*n
Space complexity will depend on the depth 'd' since the recursive function call stack has to transverse every directory and on the space complexity of traversing our name_of_entires list , which is O(n). So our space complexity is O(d + n)
